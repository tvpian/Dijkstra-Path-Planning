# Dijkstra Path Planning for Point Robots
## Installing the dependencies

*To install Matplotlib*
```
pip install matplotlib
```
*To install Pandas*
```
pip install pandas
```
*To install Numpy*
```
pip install numpy
```
*To install OpenCV*
```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the code
```
cd proj2_tharun_puthanveettil/code
python dijkstra_tharun_puthanveettil.py
```
Note:
Give the input in the following format:
```
Starting state: x_i,y_i Note: No spaces between x_i,y_i and brackets
Goal state: x_g,y_g Note: No spaces between x_g,y_g and brackets
```
Note: Due to resolution issues in the visualization tools, kindly be cautious while giving extreme cases as inputs. The code might run in cases where the start node is the wall beacuase of the resolution issue even though it is not expected to be the case.

## Outputs
The output files - Final.avi will be stored in the folder proj2_tharun_puthanveettil/code


## Test Case Results - To show successful implementation of Searching and Backtracking
The video result for a random case: [200,200] stored in the folder proj2_tharun_puthanveettil/results
